### Looking at events per state

#### Mystery States


```r
str(data$STATE)                                 ## 72 levels???
```

```
##  Factor w/ 72 levels "AK","AL","AM",..: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...
```

```r
temp <- levels(data$STATE) %in% state.abb       ## which are not in state.abb?
levels(data$STATE)[!temp]                       ## 22 mystery state codes...
```

```
##  [1] "AM" "AN" "AS" "DC" "GM" "GU" "LC" "LE" "LH" "LM" "LO" "LS" "MH" "PH" "PK"
## [16] "PM" "PR" "PZ" "SL" "ST" "VI" "XX"
```

Mystery states turned out to be places like Guam, as a look at `BGN_LOCATI`, `STATEOFFIC`, or `COUNTYNAME` shows (`head(data[data$STATE=="GU",])`).

#### How many events for the non-standard state codes?


```r
states <- summary(data$STATE)
states[levels(data$STATE)[!temp]]     ## look at the 22 mystery states
```

```
##   AM   AN   AS   DC   GM   GU   LC   LE   LH   LM   LO   LS   MH   PH   PK   PM 
## 1879 3250  257  437 5337  306  274 1526  654 1347   70  262    1   28   23    1 
##   PR   PZ   SL   ST   VI   XX 
## 3015   96    7    1  338    2
```

```r
other <- sum(states[levels(data$STATE)[!temp]])
other                                 ## 19111
```

```
## [1] 19111
```

```r
other/sum(states) * 100               ##
```

```
## [1] 2.118039
```

#### Which State has had the most events?


```r
max(states)                           ## 83728
```

```
## [1] 83728
```

```r
which.max(states)                     ## Texas (TX, 63)
```

```
## TX 
## 63
```

```r
sum(states["TX"])/sum(states) * 100   ## 
```

```
## [1] 9.279428
```

----

### Looking at dates

#### Do all the dates "play nicely"?

I.e. does `POSIXlt()` work OK with all the dates?


```r
sum(is.na(as.POSIXlt(levels(data$BGN_DATE), format="%m/%d/%Y")))        ## 0
```

```
## [1] 0
```

```r
sum(is.na(as.POSIXlt(levels(data$END_DATE), format="%m/%d/%Y")))        ## 1
```

```
## [1] 1
```

#### A Closer Look at End Dates


```r
str(data$END_DATE)      ## some of the end dates are missing values (i.e. "")
```

```
##  Factor w/ 6663 levels "","1/1/1993 0:00:00",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
```

```r
sum(data$END_DATE == "")                                ## 243411 missing values
```

```
## [1] 243411
```

```r
sum(data$END_DATE == "")/length(data$END_DATE) * 100    ## about 27%
```

```
## [1] 26.97682
```

`END_DATE` data are very incomplete.

#### Range of dates


```r
min(as.POSIXlt(levels(data$BGN_DATE), format="%m/%d/%Y"))               ## "1950-01-03 GMT"
```

```
## [1] "1950-01-03 GMT"
```

```r
max(as.POSIXlt(levels(data$BGN_DATE), format="%m/%d/%Y"))               ## "2011-11-30 GMT"
```

```
## [1] "2011-11-30 GMT"
```

```r
min(as.POSIXlt(levels(data$END_DATE), format="%m/%d/%Y"), na.rm=TRUE)   ## "1986-04-10 BST"
```

```
## [1] "1986-04-10 BST"
```

```r
max(as.POSIXlt(levels(data$END_DATE), format="%m/%d/%Y"), na.rm=TRUE)   ## "2011-11-30 GMT"
```

```
## [1] "2011-11-30 GMT"
```

So begin dates go from January 1950 to the end of November 2011, whereas end dates only start in April 1986.

### Numeric values of `PROPDMGEXP`

We'll have a look at some of the records where `PROPDMGEXP` is 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. If `PROPDMGEXP` is indeed an exponent these events would be pretty costly.


```r
prop4 <- data[data$PROPDMGEXP == 4,]    ## 4 records
prop5 <- data[data$PROPDMGEXP == 5,]    ## 28 records
prop6 <- data[data$PROPDMGEXP == 6,]    ## 4 records
prop7 <- data[data$PROPDMGEXP == 7,]    ## 5 records
prop8 <- data[data$PROPDMGEXP == 8,]    ## 1 record
as.character(prop4$REMARKS)
```

```

Flooding occurred on the Elkhorn and Niobrara river and their many tributaries.  Highways 20, 275, and 281 were closed in many locations due to running water over roads.  Numerous county roads were closed due to washed out bridge abutments and culverts.  In Rock County, three bridges were totally washed out.  Flood waters entered the towns of Lynch (Boyd County), Inman (Holt County), and Bassett (Rock County) with numerous basements flooded.

##  [2] "All Mountains, N.E. Front Range,A strong, very moist and slow moving winter storm system took aim on Colorado.  The mountains received the brunt of the storm where they measured the snow in feet.  As for the high country, all mountain ranges received at least three feet of snow with some locations in the Elk Mountains, collecting six to eight feet (72 to 96 inches).  Gothic Mountain collected 95 inches, with 24 inches of it falling on the 12th.  The new snow in the high country prompted the Colorado Avalanche Information Center to issue an extreme avalanche danger warning on the 12th for the entire Colorado backcountry.  Two people were killed by avalanches during the week.  The first fatality was a female backcountry skier who skied into avalanche danger in the Dry Gulch drainage near the east entrance to the Eisenhower Tunnel.  The other fatality was a man who was buried in his teepee residence in the Conundrum Creek valley south of Aspen on the morning of the 14th.  Road closures were common in the high country due to poor visibilities and avalanches.  Locations at or near the Passes of Berthoud, Coal Bank, Keebler, Loveland, McClure, Molas, Monarrowch, Red Mountain, and Wolf Creek were closed for a time during the storm.  In addition, Interstate 70 was closed on the 12th when an avalanche crossed the westbound lanes west of the Eisenhower Tunnel.  The interstate was reopened later that evening.  The Colorado Department of Transportation superintendent in charge of helicopter avalanche control missions, said there were more large avalanches in the backcountry then he had ever seen in his 20 years of service at CDOT.  On the afternoon of the 14th, an avalanche broke free and caused extensive structural damage to 10 condominium units near Crested Butte.  Earlier that day, west of Crested Butte on Keebler Pass, an avalanche broke and buried and damaged numerous snowmobiles parked at the Kebler Pass trailhead.  Six miles to the northwest of Crested Butte near Pittsburg, a 2,500 square foot, two-story summer home, valued between $250,000 and $300,000 was destroyed from an avalanche that had been naturally triggered off the southeast side of Purple Mountian.  Numerous damaged structures, of a lesser degree, had been reported at a few condominium complexes in the central mountains.  Eight miles west of Tennessee Pass, an avalanche swept away a 20 by 50 foot metal building off the foundation.  An avalanche three miles south of Pando, knocked two boxcars off of the rails. \nArctic air, which moved southward out of the northern plains, provided a decent supply of upslope flow for eastern Colorado.  At lower elevations, including the foothills and northern front range, the snow started falling the morning of the 10th.  Most of the snow had fallen during the 24-hour period ofter the onset.  Storm accumulation amounts ranged between \nLocations in and near the foothills received the most snow as they collected between 10 and 15 inches.  Golden and south sections of Boulder collected 15 and 14 inches respectively.  Snow amounts in northeast colorado to the east of Greeley were between three and six inches. "
##  [3] "Pea- to nickel-size hail together with torrential rainfall pummeled the town of Gilcrest and vicinity, approximately eight miles south of Greeley.  Most crops, trees and other vegetation around Gilcrest had been either flattened or stripped of leaves.  Although it rained for over two hours, the most intense rainfall which was coupled with hail lasted approximately 45 minutes.  About 22 homes and farms sustained damaging flood waters ranging in depth from two to four feet.  A Gilcrest sewer pump station had stopped due to a direct lightning strike.  Six hundred panels of glass had been broken at a Fort Lupton Greenhouse.  Total damage storm was estimated at $18 million in Weld County for property with an additional $15 million for crops.  In Morgan County the damage was $12.5 million for property with $9.8 million for crops on 22,000 acres. Frequent rainfall events over the past several weeks, mainly in the form of heavy afternoon showers and thunderstorms, had saturated the ground at many locations of the Front Range Foothills and adjacent eastern Plains.  A trend of upper level instability along with significant amounts moisture had created the afternoon showers and thunderstorms dropping anywhere between one and three and one-half inches of rainfall each afternoon and evening in their paths.  The areas most affected were locations near the South Platte River and small creeks and streams leading into the South Platte River.  The heavy rains, which started in early to middle May were most intense by the first week in June.  Twelve farms along the South Platte River  near Weldona, Kersey and Fort Morgan had been flooded and all reported substantial amounts of water in basements.

## [4] "The powerful storm that caused high winds across Oregon also spawned the most powerful tornado in the state in many years.  The tornado occurred as the coldfront associated with a deep surface low along the coast moved across the Willamette Valley in mid-afternoon.  The tornado touched down southeast of Newburg and heavily damaged a dairy farm, toppling large trees, killing six veal calves, and destroying calf shelters.  The tornado then proceeded northeasterly to a horseranch, where roofs were blown off some small buildings and extensive damage was done by flying debris, including some very large trees that were snapped off and uprooted.  The tornado next damaged the roof of a house and some nearby structures and then crossed the Willamette River. Passing motorists reported seeing the funnel sucking water up from the river.  After uprooting more trees and damaging a mobile home, the tornado apparently skipped a few miles northeast where it touched down near a mobile home park and caused extensive damage to mobile homes there. Near the northern end of the twisters path a tree at least 24 inches in diameter was snapped off six feet above ground and, along with other debris, hit a two story home and moved it off its foundation.  Incredibly, no one was injured. "

#### Strange data in `prop5`

We see that, for example, `as.character(prop5$REMARKS)[11]` says that the total damage (from lightning striking a house) was estimated to be €3500, but while `prop5$PROPDMG` is indeed 3, the exponent should be 3 also, not 5, so this is 2 orders of magnitude wrong.

Other examples of damage estimates that couldn't possibly be right (from `prop5`) include 22 ("Several homes and several hundered vehicle were damaged. ") and 24, where the awning of a shopping center and a large section of an hotel's roof was torn off. These both have `PROPDMG` set to 0, obviously wrong.

"It took more than 100 firefighters from 19 communities many hours to extinguish a fire started by lightning which destroyed a large barn at a dairy farm in Westport." However `PROPDMG` here is only 0.2, with `PROPDMGEXP == 5`. I simply cannot believe the damage described is only $20,000.

We also see that, while we have removed the empty comments, some of the remarks are `"  "` (2 spaces), which is not helpful.

#### Strange data in `prop7` and `prop8`

In the first event the police station roof and radio tower were bady damaged, and some trees were uprooted. But with `PROPDMG` of 14 and `PROPDMGEXP` of 7, I can't believe that this damage cost $140 million.

The one record ("Several homes and several hundered vehicle were damaged.") with `PROPDMGEXP == 8` has `PROPDMG` of 0.

```
## [1] 2.309993
```

we see `"THUNDERSTORM WINDS"` are highly over-represented (64%) in the data that has a numeric `PROPDMGEXP`, compared to 2.3% in the full dataset.

Maybe we would find more patterns if we looked for them...

#### Conclusion

We conclude that the numeric values of `PROPDMGEXP` don't seem to have a consistant meaning.

Well, this means that we can't assume that `PROPDMG == 0` means no property damage. For example one of the `REMARKS` where `PROPDMG == 0` explicitly states "Damage to homes and businesses was widespread." Presumably the data for crop damage is similarly flaky.

But we can only deal with the data we have. We just need to bear in mind that it is not fully accurate or complete.
